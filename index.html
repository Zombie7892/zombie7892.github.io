            Hello! My name is Kirill. I am 27 y.o. I was born in Novorossiysk.
            This is very beautiful Russian port placed on the Black Sea coast.
            Our city is famous for maritime academy and big amount of seamans.
            This is why I have got a maritime degree as my first specialty. I
            have visited a lot of countries and saw a lot of different cultures.
          </p>

            I like nature and animals. For me traveling is always connected to
            the inspiration!

            But my main activity is ART! I am drawing since childhood, but with
            some breaks for few years. During my life I tried drawing and
            painting with traditional media, digital art, design and
            illustration, sculpturing, 3D modeling and street art.

          <h3>Birds</h3>
          <p>
            Little story behind my drawings of birds: Since some moment of my
            life I started to draw birds a lot! For me bird is a symbol of
            Freedom! They have unlimited opportunities to explore the World. As
            a visual type of person I really like to observe the world around
            and would like to have same ability to fly and explore the beauty of
            out planet!

            >. Since childhood I really like to invent some interesting ideas
            and to put them on paper. It is very interesting to give your
            imagination difficult challenges.
